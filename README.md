PyCon Namibia 2017: lightning talk progress meter with Raspberry Pi and APA102 LED strip

Little demo of what cool things one can do with a Raspberry Pi. Hacked together for PyCon Namibia 2017.
It controls a LED strip to indicate remaining time for lightning talks, and can be started and reset with a button.

This uses an APA102 LED strip, well suited for use with a Raspberry Pi, because it is less timing critical. 
The library used for interfacing is https://github.com/tinue/APA102_Pi.
